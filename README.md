# Add a Session-based Shopping Cart to a Java Book Store Web App

https://app.pluralsight.com/projects/add-a-session-based-shopping-cart-to-a-java-book-store-web-app

In this project you’ll follow along with our instructions and add update and delete features to the shopping cart section of an existing Java Web application.

Setup
Set up your local environment for projects. We'll walk you through everything you need to know, including how to install and configure your environment to be able to complete all of the tasks.

Adding Update Buttons to the Shopping Cart
The Shopping Cart Feature in this app is only partially done. Add to Cart works, but there’s no way to edit the Cart, so we want to be able to Update and Delete Book quantities in the Cart.

Deleting from the Shopping Cart
Now that a Delete button exists, we're going to implement the functionality to delete a book from the Shopping Cart Session.

Updating the Shopping Cart
Finally, we will add the functionality for the Update button in the Shopping cart.
